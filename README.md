# ValClippy Chat

A conversational interface built with Next.js and OpenAI, designed to help users find information about internal projects and people. The app features a chat UI, LLM integration, and a fictional data source for demonstration.

If this was real it would search real Valtech information repositories (e.g. Confluence, SharePoint, Suite Projects Pro) however for this prototype all the data it uses is held within `/src/app/api/chat/data.json`. This data is then supplied with a prompt held within `/src/app/api/chat/route.ts` which communicates to the LLM how to answer the users questions.

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd valclippy-chat
```

### 2. Install dependencies
```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

### 3. Set up environment variables
Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory with the following:
```env
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...your-openai-key...
OPENAI_MODEL=gpt-4o-mini
```
- `OPENAI_API_KEY`: Your OpenAI API key (required)
- `OPENAI_MODEL`: (Optional) The OpenAI model to use (default: `gpt-4o-mini`)

### 4. Run the development server
```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to use the app.

## Project Structure
- `src/app/page.tsx` — Main chat UI, uses modular components/hooks
- `src/app/api/chat/route.ts` — API route for LLM chat, loads data and calls OpenAI
- `src/app/api/chat/data.json` — Fictional people and projects data
- `src/components/` — UI components (chat input, message bubble, suggestions)
- `src/hooks/` — Custom React hooks (chat state, greeting)
- `src/services/` — API call logic
- `src/utils/` — Message formatting utilities
- `src/constants/` — Greeting messages
- `src/types/` — TypeScript types
- `public/mascot.png` — Mascot image for the assistant

## Customization
- To change the fictional data, edit `src/app/api/chat/data.json`.
- To use a different OpenAI model, set `OPENAI_MODEL` in `.env.local`.

## Notes
- Tailwind CSS is used for styling. If you add new dynamic classes in injected HTML, update the safelist in `src/app/page.tsx`.
- The app is for demonstration and internal hackathon use. Do not expose your OpenAI API key publicly.
